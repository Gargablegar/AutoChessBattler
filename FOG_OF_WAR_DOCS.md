White Fog of War Implementation Documentation
============================================

Overview:
The White Fog of War debug feature limits visibility to only what white pieces can "see" 
on the battlefield. This creates a realistic tactical view where players can only see:

1. Their own territory (below the frontline)
2. Squares their pieces can move to or attack
3. Enemy pieces that are within line of sight

Implementation Details:
======================

1. Territory Visibility:
   - All squares in white's territory (below frontline) are always visible
   - Fallback: bottom quarter of the board if no frontline defined

2. Piece Vision:
   Each white piece contributes to visibility based on its movement pattern:
   
   - Rook: Sees straight lines (up/down/left/right) until blocked
   - Bishop: Sees diagonal lines until blocked  
   - Queen: Combines rook and bishop vision (8 directions)
   - King: Sees one square in all 8 directions
   - Knight: Sees L-shaped knight move positions
   - Pawn: Sees forward and diagonal attack squares

3. Line of Sight Rules:
   - Vision extends until hitting the FIRST piece in each direction
   - If the blocking piece is an enemy, it becomes visible
   - Friendly pieces block vision but are always visible anyway
   - Vision stops at board edges

4. Visual Effects:
   - Visible squares: Normal board colors
   - Fog squares: Grey checkered pattern (light/dark grey)
   - Visible enemy pieces: Rendered normally with red border highlight
   - Vision areas: Subtle blue overlay (semi-transparent)

Files Modified:
==============

1. debug.py - Core fog of war logic
   - DebugManager class handles all debug functionality
   - calculate_white_fog_of_war() - Main calculation method
   - render_white_fog_of_war() - Custom rendering with fog effects

2. main.py - Integration with game loop
   - Added DebugManager initialization
   - Added render_game() method to handle debug modes
   - Added render_with_white_fog_of_war() method

3. game_ui.py - Debug dropdown menu
   - Added debug dropdown UI components
   - State management for debug modes
   - Integration with event handling

Usage:
======

1. Run the game: python main.py
2. Click "Debug" in the top-left corner
3. Select "White fog of war" from the dropdown
4. The board will switch to fog of war view

Testing:
========

Run test_fog_of_war.py to see the calculation logic in action:
- Sets up a test board with white and black pieces
- Calculates visibility and enemy spotting
- Shows detailed analysis of each piece's vision

Example Output:
- 40 visible squares calculated
- 3 enemy pieces spotted by white pieces
- Detailed breakdown of what each piece can see

Technical Notes:
===============

1. Performance: 
   - Calculations are done per frame but are lightweight
   - Could be optimized by caching results and only recalculating on piece moves

2. Accuracy:
   - Uses the same move calculation as actual gameplay
   - Respects piece-specific movement patterns
   - Handles board boundaries correctly

3. Extensibility:
   - Easy to add black fog of war (mirror implementation)
   - Can be extended for other vision effects
   - Modular design allows for different fog rules

Future Enhancements:
===================

1. Partial Visibility: Show outlines of enemy pieces instead of full visibility
2. Memory System: Remember previously seen areas
3. Vision Range: Limit how far pieces can see regardless of movement
4. Fog Animation: Animate fog revealing/concealing areas
5. Team Vision: Share vision between allied pieces
6. Stealth Mechanics: Some pieces might be harder to spot

Debug Commands:
===============

The debug manager provides these key methods:

- calculate_white_fog_of_war(board, frontline_zones) -> (visible_squares, enemy_pieces)
- render_white_fog_of_war(screen, board, ui, frontline_zones)
- _calculate_piece_vision(piece, position, board) -> (vision, enemies_spotted)
- _trace_directional_vision(start, direction, board, color) -> (path, enemy)

Integration Example:
===================

```python
# In main game loop
if self.ui.is_debug_mode_active("white_fog"):
    self.debug_manager.render_white_fog_of_war(
        self.ui.screen, self.board, self.ui, frontline_zones
    )
else:
    # Normal rendering
    self.ui.render_board(self.board, frontline_zones)
```

This implementation provides a realistic and tactical fog of war system that enhances
the strategic depth of the AutoChess game while maintaining good performance and
visual clarity.
